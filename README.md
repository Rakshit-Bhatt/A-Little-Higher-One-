# A-Little-Higher-One-

Hi Folks.!
This is another section of this naive developer where I try to build a little bit of difficult programmes that are worth trying and damn worthy of a try.
It include a simple program with kind of GUi implemented to have an avoidance of Command-based interface.

Well I'm still learning to build little better Ui's, this repository is the center of my builds so far.
